Hi!
This is a script written in golang
to bruteforce the admin panel of a site.
First enter the domain followed by the
https / http protocol digit.

To run this program, you must have golang installed
and also a library for colours.
It is install by the command:
go get github.com/fatih/color

You can also run the script 
much faster with the commands:
chmod +x brute_admin
./brute_admin
(this is for Linux)
